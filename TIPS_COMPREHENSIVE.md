## Tip 52

**Summary:** Use smaller plates to trick your brain into feeling full.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** For your next meal, serve your food on a smaller plate (like a salad plate instead of a large dinner plate).[2]

**Why it Works:** It's a powerful visual illusion. A standard portion of food looks more abundant on a smaller plate, which can increase feelings of psychological satisfaction and fullness.[2, 9] This can help you naturally reduce your portion sizes without feeling deprived.

**How to Try It:**
• Use a 9-inch plate instead of a 12-inch one.[2]
• You can also try using smaller bowls and even smaller utensils, like appetizer forks, to further slow down your eating.[2, 3]

## Tip 53

**Summary:** Link drinking water to checking your phone.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** For one day, make this your rule: **Every time you check your phone, take a sip of water.**[10]

**Why it Works:** This is a perfect example of habit stacking. It links a new, desired behavior (drinking water) to an existing, frequent habit (checking your phone), making it almost automatic.[10, 11] It's an effortless way to stay hydrated, as thirst is often mistaken for hunger.[3]

**How to Try It:**
• Keep a water bottle on your desk, in your bag, or wherever you spend the most time with your phone.
• The cue is the action of picking up or looking at your phone.[10]
• Don't worry about big gulps; small, consistent sips add up.

## Tip 54

**Summary:** Add one healthy ingredient to every meal.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** For every meal you plate today, add one extra nutrient-rich ingredient.[10]

**Why it Works:** This is a low-friction way to boost the nutritional value of foods you already eat. It focuses on addition, not restriction, which feels positive and is easier to sustain. Over time, these small additions compound into significant health benefits.[10]

**How to Try It:**
• Toss a handful of spinach into scrambled eggs or pasta sauce.[10]
• Mix a tablespoon of chia seeds or flax seeds into yogurt or oatmeal.[2, 6]
• Add extra sliced veggies (peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes) to a sandwich or wrap.[10]

## Tip 55

**Summary:** Use a spritz of water or vinegar to season popcorn.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** Make a bowl of plain, air-popped popcorn. Instead of butter, lightly spritz it with water or plain vinegar before adding seasonings.[6]

**Why it Works:** This clever hack allows salt-free seasonings (like garlic powder, chili powder, or cinnamon) to stick to the popcorn without adding the fat and calories of butter or oil. The vinegar spritz creates a salt-and-vinegar flavor without the high-sodium seasoning packet.[6]

**How to Try It:**
• Use a small, clean spray bottle for the water or vinegar.[6]
• Spritz lightly, toss the popcorn, and then sprinkle on your seasoning.
• This makes a high-fiber, whole-grain snack that satisfies a crunchy craving.[12, 13]

## Tip 56

**Summary:** Make creamy 'ice cream' from frozen bananas.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** When you crave ice cream, blend one or two frozen, sliced bananas in a blender or food processor until it reaches a smooth, soft-serve consistency.[12, 14]

**Why it Works:** This swap delivers the cold, creamy texture of ice cream using a whole fruit base. It's naturally sweet and provides fiber and potassium without the high levels of added sugar and saturated fat found in traditional ice cream.[12, 14]

**How to Try It:**
• Peel and slice ripe bananas before freezing them on a baking sheet.[12]
• You may need to add a splash of milk or stop and scrape down the sides of the blender a few times.
• Get creative by adding a spoonful of cocoa powder for chocolate 'nice cream' or other frozen fruits like berries.[2]

## Tip 57

**Summary:** Satisfy fast-food cravings with a smaller portion.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** The next time you have an undeniable craving for a specific fast-food meal, go get it—but order a smaller version. For example, get a 6-piece nugget and small fries instead of a large combo meal.[15]

**Why it Works:** This strategy of mindful indulgence acknowledges that complete restriction often backfires, leading to binges.[15, 16] By satisfying the specific craving with a sensible portion, you avoid feelings of deprivation and the "all-or-nothing" cycle, making it a sustainable long-term approach.[15]

**How to Try It:**
• Plan the indulgence in advance to make it a conscious choice, not an impulse.
• Skip the sugary soda to save a significant amount of calories and sugar.[17]
• Savor the smaller portion mindfully, without distractions, to maximize enjoyment.[18]

## Tip 58

**Summary:** Get a quick pizza fix with this low-carb bowl.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** For a super-fast, savory craving-buster, put some pepperoni, a spoonful of tomato sauce, and shredded mozzarella cheese in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until melty and gooey.[19]

**Why it Works:** This hack isolates the most craved flavors of pizza (the savory meat, tangy sauce, and melted cheese) without the high-carb crust. It's a quick, portion-controlled way to satisfy a specific craving in under two minutes.[19]

**How to Try It:**
• Use a few slices of pepperoni, about a tablespoon of sauce, and a sprinkle of cheese.[19]
• You can add other pizza toppings you have on hand, like sliced olives or mushrooms.
• Eat with a fork to slow down and savor the flavors.

## Tip 59

**Summary:** Turn a simple apple into a fun, decadent-tasting snack.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** Slice an apple and arrange the slices on a plate. Drizzle with a spoonful of melted peanut or almond butter and sprinkle with a few dark chocolate chips.[20]

**Why it Works:** This snack hits multiple craving points—sweet, salty, and crunchy—while being based on a whole fruit. It feels indulgent but provides fiber from the apple and healthy fats and protein from the nut butter, making it far more satisfying and nutritious than a candy bar.[20, 14]

**How to Try It:**
• Use an apple corer/slicer to make it even faster.[20, 21]
• Warm the nut butter in the microwave for 10-15 seconds to make it easy to drizzle.
• Get creative with toppings like a sprinkle of cinnamon, granola, or shredded coconut.[20]

## Tip 60

**Summary:** Use a rotisserie chicken for fast, healthy protein all week.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** Buy one rotisserie chicken during your weekly grocery shop. As soon as you get home, pull the meat from the bones and store it in the fridge.[22]

**Why it Works:** This is a meal prep game-changer for busy people. It provides a ready-to-use, versatile source of lean protein, eliminating the time and effort of cooking chicken during the week. This makes assembling healthy meals incredibly fast.[23, 22]

**How to Try It:**
• Add the shredded chicken to bagged salads for a quick lunch.[5]
• Use it as a filling for wraps or quesadillas with whole-wheat tortillas.[19, 23]
• Mix it with Greek yogurt or avocado for a healthier chicken salad.[24, 25]

## Tip 61

**Summary:** Boost your breakfast with protein.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** Start your day with a protein-rich breakfast, aiming for 15-25 grams.[1]

**Why it Works:** Protein is the most satiating macronutrient. It digests slowly and suppresses hunger hormones, which helps you feel full longer and can reduce cravings later in the day.[1, 2] Your body also burns more calories digesting protein compared to carbs and fats.

**How to Try It:**
• Swap a bagel or cereal for two eggs with whole-wheat toast and avocado.[1]
• Add a scoop of protein powder or a tablespoon of peanut butter to your oatmeal.[3]
• Top high-protein frozen waffles with nuts and berries.[1]

## Tip 62

**Summary:** Swap mayonnaise for Greek yogurt or mashed avocado.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** For one day, replace the mayonnaise in your sandwiches, salads (like tuna or chicken), or spreads with either plain nonfat Greek yogurt or mashed avocado.

**Why it Works:** This swap significantly cuts saturated fat and calories. Greek yogurt provides a major protein boost, increasing satiety.[4] Mashed avocado adds healthy monounsaturated fats and fiber, which also help you feel full.[5]

**How to Try It:**
• Use a 1:1 ratio when swapping mayo for plain Greek yogurt in a recipe like tuna salad.[4]
• For a sandwich, simply spread a quarter of a mashed avocado instead of mayo.
• Add a squeeze of lemon or lime to the avocado to prevent browning.

## Tip 63

**Summary:** Swap sour cream for plain Greek yogurt or blended cottage cheese.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** Instead of using sour cream as a topping (on tacos, chili, or baked potatoes) or in a dip, use plain nonfat Greek yogurt or blended low-fat cottage cheese.

**Why it Works:** This is a high-impact swap that dramatically increases protein while cutting fat and calories. Blended cottage cheese has a neutral, creamy flavor, while Greek yogurt offers a similar tangy taste to sour cream. Both options increase satiety.[4, 6]

**How to Try It:**
• Use a 1:1 ratio of plain Greek yogurt for sour cream.
• To make a creamy base, blend low-fat cottage cheese in a food processor or blender until completely smooth. You can add ranch seasoning for a high-protein veggie dip.[6]

## Tip 64

**Summary:** Swap potato chips for air-popped popcorn.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** When you're craving a crunchy, salty snack, reach for air-popped popcorn instead of potato chips.

**Why it Works:** Popcorn is a whole grain, providing significantly more fiber and volume for far fewer calories than chips. This satisfies the desire for a crunchy snack while helping you feel full and avoiding the high fat content of fried chips.[7, 8]

**How to Try It:**
• Use an air popper or the paper bag method in the microwave to pop plain kernels.
• Control the salt yourself and experiment with other seasonings like chili powder, garlic powder, or nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor.[7]

## Tip 65

**Summary:** Swap ice cream for frozen grapes or 'nice cream'.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** When a craving for a sweet, frozen dessert strikes, try eating a bowl of frozen grapes or making banana 'nice cream' instead of regular ice cream.

**Why it Works:** These swaps provide the sweet, cold, and creamy sensations of ice cream using whole fruits, which contain natural sugars, fiber, and micronutrients without the high levels of added sugar and saturated fat found in most ice creams.[9] Frozen grapes develop a sorbet-like texture.[10]

**How to Try It:**
• For frozen grapes, simply wash, dry, and freeze a bunch of grapes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Store in a freezer-safe bag.
• For 'nice cream', blend one or two frozen, sliced bananas in a blender or food processor until it reaches a smooth, soft-serve consistency.[11]

## Tip 66

**Summary:** Swap ground beef for 99% lean ground turkey.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** In a recipe that calls for ground beef, such as pasta sauce, tacos, or burgers, use 99% lean ground turkey or chicken instead.

**Why it Works:** This simple swap dramatically reduces the total and saturated fat content of your meal without sacrificing the satisfying texture of ground meat. This is an easy way to make favorite comfort foods healthier.[4, 6]

**How to Try It:**
• Substitute it 1:1 in any recipe.
• Since lean turkey is lower in fat, you may need to add a small amount of oil to the pan to prevent sticking.
• Be sure to season it well, as it has a milder flavor than beef.

## Tip 67

**Summary:** Reorganize your plate: ½ veggies, ¼ protein, ¼ whole grains.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** For one meal, visually divide your plate and fill half of it with non-starchy vegetables, one quarter with lean protein, and one quarter with whole grains.[3, 12]

**Why it Works:** This simple visual guide, promoted by Harvard's Healthy Eating Plate, naturally increases your intake of fiber, vitamins, and minerals while managing portions of more calorie-dense starches and proteins. It promotes fullness and nutrient density without needing to count calories.[3, 12]

**How to Try It:**
• Start by filling the largest section (half your plate) with colorful veggies like broccoli, spinach, bell peppers, or a large salad.
• Add a palm-sized portion of lean protein like grilled chicken, fish, or beans.[12]
• Fill the final quarter with a fist-sized portion of whole grains like quinoa, brown rice, or whole-wheat pasta.[12]
• Note: Starchy veggies like potatoes, corn, and peas count as grains in this model.[3]

## Tip 68

**Summary:** Brush your teeth right after dinner to prevent evening snacking.

**Details:**
**The Experiment:** Tonight, make it a point to brush and floss your teeth immediately after you finish eating dinner.

**Why it Works:** This simple habit creates a powerful psychological cue that eating is finished for the day. The clean, minty feeling makes other foods and drinks (besides water) less appealing, which can effectively curb mindless late-night snacking or dessert cravings.[13]

**How to Try It:**
• As soon as you've cleared your plate, head to the bathroom and complete your dental routine.
• Make it a non-negotiable part of your dinner cleanup process.
• If a craving hits later, the thought of having to brush again can be a deterrent.
