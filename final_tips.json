After an overnight fast, it also helps stabilize blood sugar and provides sustained energy.\n\n**How to Try It:**\n• Scramble 2-3 eggs instead of having just toast or cereal\n• Stir a scoop of protein powder into your oatmeal or yogurt\n• A cup of Greek yogurt or cottage cheese can provide over 20g of protein",

The higher fiber content helps you feel full for longer, aids in digestion, and supports more stable blood sugar levels.\n\n**How to Try It:**\n• Swap white pasta for whole-wheat pasta\n• Choose brown rice instead of white rice with your stir-fry or curry\n• Make a sandwich using 100% whole-wheat bread.

It's a smart swap that aligns with fitness goals.\n\n**How to Try It:**\n• In a small bowl, mix one scoop of casein or a whey/casein blend protein powder (vanilla or chocolate work well) with a very small amount of milk or water\n• Stir vigorously, adding liquid a tiny bit at a time, until it reaches a thick, pudding-like consistency\n• For best results, chill in the freezer for 10-15 minutes",

You'll likely feel more satisfied with less food.\n\n**How to Try It:**\n• Set a timer for 20 minutes when you start eating\n• Put your fork down between bites\n• Chew each bite thoroughly (aim for 20-30 chews)\n• Take sips of water throughout the meal\n• Engage in conversation if eating with others",
