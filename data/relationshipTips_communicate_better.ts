    "details_md": "**The Experiment:** Replace one blaming \"you always\" or \"you never\" statement with a calm I-statement that names your feeling and why.\n\n**Why it Works:** I-statements reduce defensiveness by focusing on your experience rather than attacking your partner's character. This opens space for understanding rather than conflict escalation.\n\n**How to Try It:**\n• Notice when you want to say \"you always\" or \"you never\"\n• Pause and identify your feeling\n• Use: \"I feel [emotion] because [specific situation]\"\n• Focus on the current issue, not personality traits",
