    "details_md": `**The Experiment:** Use a Gottman‑style softened startup: “I feel [emotion] about [situation]. I need [specific request] so that [shared benefit].”\n\n**Why it Works:** Softened startups reduce defensiveness and escalation by leading with feelings, not accusations. They align with Gottman’s behaviorally specific scripts and IBCT’s acceptance‑plus‑change stance. Clear requests invite success; shared benefits maintain teamwork.\n\n**How to Try It:**\n• Draft two versions; pick the calmer one.\n• Speak slowly and sit down.\n• End with “Does that make sense?”`,
