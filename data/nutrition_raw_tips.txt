1) Hide-and-hurdle your junk food today
summary: Put friction on junk; make the healthy option the default path.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Move all sweets and chips to a high, opaque bin; place fruit and nuts at eye level.

### Why it Works
Self-control is limited; environment beats willpower. Stable cues plus repeated responses form habits, and early wins build self-efficacy. Making unhealthy choices effortful and healthy choices obvious reduces exposure to temptation and conserves psychological resources.

### How to Try It
- Use an opaque container; store treats on the highest shelf.
- Pre‑wash fruit; put a bowl on the counter.
- Portion nuts into small bags for grab‑and‑go.


2) Pre-commit your dinner before you arrive
summary: Decide your restaurant order at home; star the menu pick now.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Check the restaurant menu beforehand and lock in a grilled/baked entrée with vegetables.

### Why it Works
Pre‑commitment removes in‑the‑moment impulsivity when hunger and reward cues spike. Mixed dishes often hide sugar, sodium, and fat. Simple preparations reduce the fat‑sugar reward combo that amplifies overeating.

### How to Try It
- Read the menu online; write your choice in your notes.
- Text a friend your plan for accountability.
- Ask for sauces on the side when you order.


3) Protein-fiber pre-load before dining out
summary: Eat a mini protein‑fiber snack an hour before the reservation.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Have Greek yogurt or a boiled egg plus an apple 45–60 minutes pre‑meal.

### Why it Works
Protein and fiber slow digestion, stabilize glucose, and blunt crash‑driven cravings. Keeping levels steady reduces the urge for rapid‑energy sweets and the fat‑sugar reward loop.

### How to Try It
- Keep eggs, yogurt, or edamame ready in the fridge.
- Pair fruit with nuts or string cheese.
- Set a reminder one hour before leaving.


4) Box half before the first bite
summary: Ask for a to‑go box upfront; halve portions immediately.
details_md:

### The Experiment
At restaurants, request a box with your entrée and pack half right away.

### Why it Works
Large portions and rich preparations drive overeating. Pre‑portioning reframes the default, reduces exposure to hyper‑palatable fat‑sugar combos, and preserves self‑control for dessert decisions.

### How to Try It
- Tell the server: “Could I get a box with the entrée?”
- Move half the meal before eating anything.
- Share plates when boxing isn’t possible.


5) Split or size-down dessert strategically
summary: Share a small dessert, or choose fruit‑forward options intentionally.
details_md:

### The Experiment
If you indulge, order one small dessert for the table or a fruit‑based option.

### Why it Works
Fat and sugar together hyper‑activate distinct reward pathways. Strategic indulgence keeps enjoyment without abandoning the plan and avoids the richest fat‑sugar combinations.

### How to Try It
- Suggest one dessert with four spoons.
- Choose sorbet, baked apples, or fruit crumble.
- Stop at three mindful bites; savor slowly.


6) Thirst check before sweets
summary: Drink a tall glass of water, then reassess the craving.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Before any sweet snack, drink 12–16 oz of water and wait five minutes.

### Why it Works
Hydration lapses and mineral needs can masquerade as sugar hunger. A brief pause lets protein/fiber timing and satiety signals catch up.

### How to Try It
- Keep a filled bottle at arm’s reach.
- Add a squeeze of lemon for appeal.
- Set a “water first” phone reminder.


7) Carb-with-company rule
summary: Never eat simple carbs alone; always pair with protein or fat.
details_md:

### The Experiment
If you eat bread, crackers, or fruit, add cheese, nuts, or yogurt.

### Why it Works
Simple carbs alone spike and crash glucose, intensifying cravings. Pairing slows absorption, steadies energy, and reduces the drive for quick sugar fixes.

### How to Try It
- Apple + peanut butter; crackers + tuna.
- Oatmeal + Greek yogurt swirl.
- Rice + edamame or eggs.


8) Add one fermented food today
summary: Feed your gut; add kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut, or kombucha now.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Include one serving of fermented food with lunch or dinner.

### Why it Works
Emerging evidence links the gut‑brain axis to sugar preference. Microbial activity can influence GLP‑1 signaling and sweet desire; supporting microbiota may reduce sugar‑seeking.

### How to Try It
- Top bowls with kimchi or sauerkraut.
- Swap milk for a glass of kefir.
- Choose low‑sugar kombucha with meals.


9) Fruit‑first dessert swap
summary: Replace tonight’s dessert with a colorful, vitamin‑rich fruit bowl.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Make dessert from frozen mango, kiwi, or raspberries with cinnamon.

### Why it Works
Whole fruit delivers fiber, water, and micronutrients, satisfying sweetness with better satiety than refined sweets and avoiding the fat‑sugar synergy of rich desserts.

### How to Try It
- Keep frozen fruit on hand for speed.
- Add a spoon of applesauce and cinnamon.
- Serve in a small bowl to anchor portions.


10) Cocoa banana bites over chocolate bars
summary: Freeze cocoa‑dusted banana coins for a quick sweet fix.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Slice bananas, dust with unsweetened cocoa, freeze 30–60 minutes.

### Why it Works
You satisfy chocolate cravings with fiber and volume, not added fat‑sugar. This reduces reward overdrive while still feeling indulgent.

### How to Try It
- Use a zip bag and sheet pan.
- Add a few crushed almonds for texture.
- Portion 6–8 coins per serving.


11) Build a travel snack kit now
summary: Pack protein‑fiber snacks to prevent desperate airport or road choices.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Assemble a kit: nuts, jerky, fruit, yogurt (if chilled), and water.

### Why it Works
Going >5 hours without food heightens impulsivity and preference for ultra‑processed options. Planned protein/fiber stabilizes energy and curbs crash‑driven sweets.

### How to Try It
- Portion ¼ cup almonds into bags.
- Pack jerky or cheese sticks.
- Refill a bottle past security.


12) Set travel mealtime anchors
summary: Keep breakfast–lunch–dinner timing consistent despite delays.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Choose three anchor times today and eat roughly within those windows.

### Why it Works
Routine supports circadian and metabolic regularity, buffering buffet or fast‑food environments. Predictability reduces decision fatigue and overeating risk.

### How to Try It
- Calendar reminders for meal windows.
- Carry a backup snack for delays.
- Avoid grazing between anchors.


13) One‑plate buffet rule
summary: Survey first, then one plate: lean protein, vegetables, whole grains.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Walk the buffet before serving; build a single plate from basics.

### Why it Works
Scanning first avoids impulsive piling. Lean proteins and intact grains reduce the fat‑sugar reward pull and keep glucose steadier.

### How to Try It
- Fill half the plate with vegetables.
- Choose grilled/roasted proteins.
- Skip creamy sauces; add lemon or salsa.


14) Bring a “safe” dish to social events
summary: Arrive with a colorful salad or low‑sugar dessert you’ll enjoy.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Contribute a dish aligned with your goals to tonight’s gathering.

### Why it Works
Shifting focus to connection rather than food reduces social pressure. Having one reliable option protects the plan and helps others, too.

### How to Try It
- Pre‑wash greens; add beans and seeds.
- Make baked apples with oats and cinnamon.
- Place your dish near your seat.


15) Conversation‑first at parties
summary: Lead with people, not plates; set a social engagement goal.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Pick three people to meaningfully connect with before any food.

### Why it Works
When attention centers on relationships, food is no longer the reward mechanism. This reduces environmental cues driving automatic eating.

### How to Try It
- Stand away from the snack table.
- Hold a zero‑calorie drink as a prop.
- Ask open‑ended questions to extend chats.


16) Start with a non‑alcoholic drink
summary: Quench thirst first; slow the pace before any alcohol.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Begin with sparkling water or diet soda before your first drink.

### Why it Works
Alcohol adds discretionary calories and health risks. Drinking with food and pacing slows absorption; starting non‑alcoholic reduces total intake.

### How to Try It
- Order sparkling water with lime.
- Eat protein before sipping alcohol.
- Alternate each alcoholic drink with water.


17) Use tall, skinny wine glasses
summary: Visual cues matter; pour less without noticing in slender glassware.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Tonight, drink wine from a tall, narrow glass.

### Why it Works
Glass shape influences perceived volume. Subtle environmental tweaks reduce total alcohol consumed without relying on willpower.

### How to Try It
- Swap goblets for flutes/tall glasses.
- Pour to a consistent marker line.
- Put the bottle out of reach.


18) Store alcohol out of sight
summary: Out of sight, out of sip; relocate bottles to a closed cabinet.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Move alcohol to a cabinet or secondary fridge today.

### Why it Works
Reducing visual cues lowers unplanned consumption. Environmental control conserves self‑control for more meaningful choices.

### How to Try It
- Clear the bar cart; add seltzers instead.
- Keep a single bottle chilled, not multiples.
- Use smaller purchase volumes.


19) Pace with food and time
summary: Eat while drinking and set a time cap for the last pour.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Consume alcohol only with a meal and set a hard stop time.

### Why it Works
Food slows absorption; pacing curbs total intake. Respecting guideline limits reduces cardiometabolic and cancer risks tied to alcohol.

### How to Try It
- Start drinking mid‑meal, not pre‑meal.
- Use a timer for a two‑hour window.
- Switch to tea after the stop time.


20) Set a realistic habit timeline
summary: Ditch the 21‑day myth; plan for gradual, steady habit formation.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Pick one habit and set a 6–10‑week horizon with weekly check‑ins.

### Why it Works
Unrealistic timelines cause discouragement. Expectation management plus early, small wins builds self-efficacy and persistence.

### How to Try It
- Track a single daily action in a checklist.
- Celebrate weekly streaks, not perfection.
- Reduce the habit to a 2‑minute starter.


21) Write one If‑Then plan for boredom
summary: Pre‑decide: “If bored, then I’ll do X,” not snack.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Create one Implementation Intention to replace boredom eating today.

### Why it Works
Boredom seeks stimulation; If‑Then plans automate a goal-directed response. Habit stacking cements the new behavior onto an existing cue.

### How to Try It
- “If scrolling, then 10 bodyweight squats.”
- “If TV ads, then make tea.”
- “If waiting, then text a friend.”


22) Stack water onto mealtime cues
summary: Tie a glass of water to every meal setup step.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Before plating, drink a full glass as part of the routine.

### Why it Works
Habit stacking uses stable cues to lock in beneficial actions. Hydration reduces misinterpreted sugar cravings and supports appetite control.

### How to Try It
- Place a glass on the counter before cooking.
- Fill it before opening the fridge.
- Keep a pitcher visible at the table.


23) Create a 3–4-hour fueling rhythm
summary: Prevent crashes; add protein and fiber every 3–4 hours.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Schedule snacks or small meals to avoid >5 hours without food.

### Why it Works
Long gaps trigger crash-driven cravings and impulsive, ultra-processed choices. Steady intake stabilizes glucose and reduces sweet seeking.

### How to Try It
- Set reminders at 10:30 a.m. and 3 p.m.
- Pair fruit with nuts or yogurt.
- Keep shelf-stable protein at work.


24) “Simple over mixed” restaurant rule
summary: Choose grilled or baked basics; skip complex, hidden-calorie dishes.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Order straightforward entrées and avoid stews, burritos, and creamy pastas.

### Why it Works
Mixed dishes hide added sugar, sodium, and fat. Choosing simple prep lowers exposure to fat-sugar reward synergy.

### How to Try It
- Ask for grilled fish/chicken with vegetables.
- Replace fries with a side salad.
- Request extra lemon, herbs, or salsa.


25) Front-load calories earlier today
summary: Bigger breakfast or lunch; lighter, earlier dinner for circadian alignment.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Shift more calories to earlier meals and eat dinner on the light side.

### Why it Works
Late eating disrupts ghrelin-leptin balance, increases hunger, and impairs glucose handling. Chrononutrition favors earlier intake for metabolic efficiency.

### How to Try It
- Add eggs and oats to breakfast.
- Move dessert to mid-afternoon fruit.
- Keep dinner lean protein and vegetables.


26) Close the kitchen three hours before bed
summary: Set a nightly stop-eating time to support sleep and metabolism.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Choose a “kitchen closed” time tonight—at least three hours pre-bed.

### Why it Works
Eating near biological night worsens glucose tolerance and increases hunger signals. A firm window reduces late-night snacking drivers.

### How to Try It
- Set an alarm for the cutoff.
- Dim kitchen lights as a cue.
- Brew non-caffeinated tea post-cutoff.


27) Make a sensory boredom kit
summary: Replace snack stimulation with engaging non-food sensations.
details_md:

### How to Try It
- Put utensils down between bites.
- Rate fullness after three bites.
- Stop at “satisfied,” not stuffed.


50) Picky-eater exposure + clinical triage
summary: One-bite exposure today; note ARFID signs and plan specialist follow-up.
details_md:

### The Experiment
Add one bite of a new food with a familiar dip or texture.

### Why it Works
Gentle exposure expands flexibility. Distinguish preference from ARFID (sensory aversion, fear of choking/vomiting, or low interest), which benefits from specialized CBT and rarely remits without care.

### How to Try It
- Pair a new veg with a preferred sauce.
- Keep bites tiny and predictable.
- If ARFID features fit, schedule a consult.


51) Ban the bread basket
summary: Ask the server not to bring bread; remove default grazing.
