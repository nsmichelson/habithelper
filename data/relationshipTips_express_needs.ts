    "details_md": `**The Experiment:** Today, express one need by saying what you DO want rather than what you don't want.

**Why it Works:** Positive requests give clear direction for action, while negative requests only say what to avoid, leaving partners guessing.

**How to Try It:**
• Identify what you don't want
• Flip it to what you do want
• Example: Instead of \"Don't ignore me\" try \"I need some attention tonight\"
• Be specific about the action you'd like`,

**Why it Works:** Percentages communicate urgency and intensity clearly, helping partners prioritize competing needs.

**How to Try It:**
• Identify your need and its intensity
• Express as percentage: \"I'm 90% needing help with this\"
• Ask about their needs too
• Negotiate based on relative intensities`,

**Why it Works:** Distinguishing between physical and emotional needs helps partners respond appropriately to each type.

**How to Try It:**
• Identify one physical need right now
• Identify one emotional need
• Share both: \"Physically I need... Emotionally I need...\"
• Ask about your partner's needs in both categories`,

• Set up shared notes app or whiteboard
• Write needs as they arise

• Practice even with small needs

• Include: alone time, hug, help, listening ear, distraction

• Share at low intensity: \"I'm starting to need some alone time\"
• Don't wait until desperate
