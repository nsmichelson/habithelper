    "details_md": `**The Experiment:** For every conversation today, place your phone face-down or in another room.

**Why it Works:** Visible phones divide attention even when silent. Removing the visual cue allows full presence and eye contact.

**How to Try It:**
• Before conversations, flip phone face-down
• Better yet, place it in another room
• Notice the urge to check it
• Return focus to the person speaking`,

    "details_md": `**The Experiment:** After someone finishes speaking, silently count to three before responding.

**Why it Works:** This pause ensures they're truly finished and gives you time to process rather than plan your response while they talk.

**How to Try It:**
• Listen until they stop speaking
• Count silently: one-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, three
• Then formulate your response
• Notice if they add more in the pause`,

**Why it Works:** Follow-up questions show genuine interest and help you understand their experience fully before shifting focus.

**How to Try It:**
• Listen to their story or concern
• Before relating your experience, ask: \"How did that feel?\" or \"What happened next?\"
• Listen to their answer
• Then share if appropriate`,

**Why it Works:** Recognizing emotions shows deep listening and helps speakers feel truly heard and understood.

**How to Try It:**
• Listen for feeling words or tone
• Tentatively name what you notice: \"Sounds frustrating\" or \"You seem excited\"
• Use tentative language: seems, sounds like, appears

• When someone starts speaking, turn fully toward them
• Square your shoulders to face them
• Uncross arms if crossed
• Lean slightly forward to show engagement`,

• Notice the urge to problem-solve
• Pause that impulse
• Say: \"Tell me more about that\"

• If sad, soften your energy

• Listen to their complete story
• Notice urge to say \"Me too\" or \"That reminds me\"
• Resist sharing your similar story
• Instead ask how they felt or what they learned`,
