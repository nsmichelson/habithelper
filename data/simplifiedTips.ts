A simple olive oil and vinegar dressing provides heart-healthy monounsaturated fats.\n\n**How to Try It:**\n• The classic ratio is 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar\n• In a small jar, combine 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil with 1 tablespoon of balsamic or red wine vinegar\n• Add a pinch of salt, pepper, and maybe a little Dijon mustard.
