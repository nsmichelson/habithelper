# Nutrition Tip Obstacles

1. **Put friction on junk; make the healthy option the default path.**
   - Family members or roommates may resist moving their snacks or object to the new kitchen organization.
   - Limited storage space might make it difficult to find high or hidden spots for unhealthy items.
   - In moments of high stress, the barrier of a high shelf may not be enough to stop a craving.
   - Out of sight might mean out of mind, leading to food waste if treats go stale or are forgotten.
   - You might simply forget where you hid things, leading to frustration when you do want a treat.

2. **Decide your restaurant order at home; star the menu pick now.**
   - The restaurant might change their menu or be out of the specific item you chose.
   - Social pressure from friends ordering appetizers or specials might make you change your mind.

5. **Share a small dessert, or choose fruit-forward options intentionally.**
   - Dining companions might not want to share or might prefer a rich, chocolatey dessert.
   - The restaurant might not offer any fruit-based or small dessert options.
   - You might feel unsatisfied with just a few bites if everyone else is indulging fully.
   - "Sharing" can sometimes lead to a competition for bites, causing you to eat faster.
   - You might have a specific craving that fruit simply won't satisfy.

6. **Drink a tall glass of water, then reassess the craving.**
   - You might ignore the pause and eat the snack anyway because the craving is emotional, not thirst.
   - If you are already bloated or have drunk a lot, more water might feel uncomfortable.
   - You might not have water readily available in that specific moment (e.g., driving).
