---

### 2. Freeze strong ginger tea into cubes for instant nausea tea.

**⚠️ CONTRAINDICATIONS:** Skip if ginger triggers reflux; mind dental sensitivity if sucking frozen cubes. Large amounts of ginger may interact with blood thinners or increase reflux; limit if advised by your clinician. Cool foods quickly, store safely, and reheat leftovers to 165°F; eat within 3–4 days once thawed.

**The Experiment:** Brew a pot of strong ginger tea, freeze in an ice tray, and pop a cube into hot water when queasy.

**Why it Works:** Batch-prepped ginger removes friction on rough days so you can self-soothe fast.

**How to Try It:**
• Steep sliced fresh ginger or tea bags 10–15 minutes.
• Freeze in an ice cube tray and store in a zip bag.
• Use 1–2 cubes in hot water or suck a cube if cold helps.

### 3. Suck on frozen lemon-ginger cubes when liquids are hard to tolerate.

**⚠️ CONTRAINDICATIONS:** Citrus may worsen reflux; rinse mouth after to protect enamel. Large amounts of ginger may interact with blood thinners or increase reflux; limit if advised by your clinician. Citrus can aggravate reflux or tooth enamel; rinse mouth after acidic drinks and avoid if symptoms worsen.

**The Experiment:** Freeze diluted lemonade with grated ginger into ice cubes to sip/suck during nausea.

**Why it Works:** Cold, tart flavors are often easier to handle and keep hydration going in tiny sips.

**How to Try It:**
• Mix water + a splash of lemonade; add optional ginger.
• Freeze in trays; keep a bag in the freezer.
• Use during commutes or morning routines.

### 4. Chew peppermint gum or suck mints to mask odors and ease nausea.

**⚠️ CONTRAINDICATIONS:** Peppermint can worsen reflux; avoid if sensitive. Peppermint may relax the LES and worsen reflux; choose non‑mint flavors if GERD is an issue.

**The Experiment:** Use peppermint gum or mints when smells trigger queasiness (kitchen, car, workplace).

**Why it Works:** Peppermint aroma can distract from odor triggers and may soothe the stomach while saliva neutralizes acid.

**How to Try It:**
• Keep a pack in your bag and car.
• Try sugar-free gum if managing blood sugar or dental health.
• Use before entering strong-smell environments.

### 5. If plain water tastes bad, flavor it lightly (citrus, mint, flat ginger ale).

**⚠️ CONTRAINDICATIONS:** Limit sugary beverages; carbonation may bloat—adjust to comfort. Large amounts of ginger may interact with blood thinners or increase reflux; limit if advised by your clinician. Citrus can aggravate reflux or tooth enamel; rinse mouth after acidic drinks and avoid if symptoms worsen. If managing gestational diabetes, limit added sugars in mixers (use diluted juice). Avoid caffeinated sodas late in the day; prefer caffeine‑free options.

**The Experiment:** Add lemon/lime, a splash of juice, or use flat ginger ale in small sips to meet hydration goals.

**Why it Works:** Mild flavors reduce aversion and encourage steady sipping, preventing dehydration that worsens nausea.

**How to Try It:**
• Keep lemon wedges or mint in the fridge.
• Try flavored ice cubes (juice + water).
• Use a straw if that makes sipping easier.

### 6. Keep crackers by the bed and nibble before sitting up.

*Tip ID: `84271016-fed4-4b53-a1e9-ad80725ee917`*

---

### 7. Have a protein-rich bedtime snack to ease morning nausea.

**⚠️ CONTRAINDICATIONS:** Avoid large/fatty meals close to bed if prone to reflux.

**The Experiment:** Eat a small protein snack (Greek yogurt, cheese stick, peanut butter on crackers) before bed.

**Why it Works:** Protein slows digestion and stabilizes blood sugar overnight, which may reduce morning queasiness.

**How to Try It:**
• Choose ~10–15g protein (yogurt, cheese, nut butter).
• Keep portions small to prevent reflux.
• Pair with a few crackers if needed.

*Tip ID: `b1fb0db1-90cd-4a87-a688-65510a7f134e`*

### 8. Use the 'P' fruits (prunes, pears, plums, pumpkin) for constipation.

**⚠️ CONTRAINDICATIONS:** Reduce/stop if stools become too loose.

**The Experiment:** Add one serving of a 'P' fruit daily until regular (e.g., 4–6 prunes or a ripe pear).

**Why it Works:** Fiber and natural sorbitol draw water into the stool and promote movement.

**How to Try It:**
• Start with one serving and increase as needed.
• Combine with water to boost effect.
• Rotate fruits to keep it enjoyable.

*Tip ID: `35f529a1-e92f-403c-ba16-de140af4aeab`*

### 9. Stir chia or ground flax into meals for invisible fiber.

**⚠️ CONTRAINDICATIONS:** Increase gradually to minimize bloating; ensure adequate fluids.

**The Experiment:** Add 1 tablespoon of chia or ground flaxseed to oatmeal, yogurt, or smoothies daily.

**Why it Works:** Soluble fiber absorbs water to soften stool and promote regularity; it also adds omega‑3s.

**How to Try It:**
• Start with 1 tsp and build up to 1 Tbsp to avoid gas.
• Drink water with added fiber.
• Store ground flax in the fridge.

*Tip ID: `7f7df02d-5354-40ef-b35e-22a445d56241`*

### 10. Try a daily kiwi (or two) to stay regular.

**⚠️ CONTRAINDICATIONS:** Stop if stools become loose; consider oral allergy syndrome if sensitive to kiwi.

**The Experiment:** Eat 1–2 ripe kiwis each day, scooped with a spoon or added to yogurt.

**Why it Works:** Kiwifruit offers fiber and enzymes that can support gentle bowel movement.

**How to Try It:**
• Keep a few ripening on the counter, then refrigerate.
• Pair with yogurt or cereal for a quick snack.
• Choose golden kiwi if you prefer milder flavor.

### 13. Chew gum or munch a few almonds after meals for heartburn relief.

**⚠️ CONTRAINDICATIONS:** Avoid nuts if allergic; mint gum can aggravate reflux for some—try fruit flavors.

**The Experiment:** After eating, chew sugar‑free gum or eat 5–10 raw almonds.

**Why it Works:** Chewing boosts saliva, which can neutralize acid; almonds may buffer stomach acid for some.

**How to Try It:**
• Keep gum or almonds in your bag or nightstand.
• Chew 10–20 minutes after meals.
• Pair with staying upright for at least an hour.

*Tip ID: `77f34008-5bb3-4a16-a5c8-d252fb74f85e`*

### 14. Try a warm ACV + honey drink for reflux relief.

**⚠️ CONTRAINDICATIONS:** May aggravate reflux or damage enamel; avoid if advised by clinician or with esophagitis. Avoid undiluted ACV; may irritate esophagus or enamel. Not a replacement for medical GERD treatment; stop if pain or burning worsens.

**The Experiment:** Mix 1 tsp apple cider vinegar + 1 tsp honey in warm water and sip slowly.

**Why it Works:** Some find small amounts of ACV tone digestion and reduce symptoms; warmth is soothing.

**How to Try It:**
• Start with 1 tsp ACV; increase only if helpful.
• Rinse mouth after to protect enamel.
• Stop if it worsens symptoms.

*Tip ID: `4a9675df-9669-4703-8022-77022718c89e`*

---

### 22. If prenatals make you sick, ask about children's vitamins as a short‑term bridge.

**⚠️ CONTRAINDICATIONS:** Only with clinician guidance; gummies may lack iron/iodine/choline. Use only with clinician guidance; children’s gummies often lack iron/iodine/choline and are a temporary bridge, not a full replacement.

**The Experiment:** With clinician approval, use chewable kids’ multivitamins temporarily until nausea improves.

**Why it Works:** Better than nothing when pills won’t stay down; easier on the stomach.

**How to Try It:**
• Confirm dose/brand with your provider.
• Keep focusing on folate‑rich foods meanwhile.
• Resume a full prenatal as soon as tolerated.

*Tip ID: `8753afeb-59d0-4d5c-9e0d-70b3fa0268c5`*

### 23. If veggies are a no‑go, lean on fruits, beans, eggs, and dairy for nutrients.

**⚠️ CONTRAINDICATIONS:** Use only pasteurized dairy. If lactose intolerant, choose lactose‑free or fortified non‑dairy alternatives.

**The Experiment:** Build meals from tolerated foods that still supply folate, iron, calcium, and protein.

**Why it Works:** You can meet needs without forcing trigger foods; variety returns as nausea lifts.

**How to Try It:**
• Prioritize fruit smoothies, beans/lentils, eggs, and yogurt.
• Add a prenatal and 'gap' foods like choline‑rich eggs when possible.
• Re‑test veggies later in tiny portions.

*Tip ID: `bd42db75-c10e-498c-bd8c-8cf85af0f51f`*

---

### 24. Blend extra veggies (and white beans) into pasta sauces and soups.

**The Experiment:** Sauté mild veggies/beans, then purée into tomato sauce or soup.

**Why it Works:** Increases fiber, folate, and iron without 'veggie' taste or smell.

### 49. Find a healthy 'safe meal' you love—and repeat it.

**⚠️ CONTRAINDICATIONS:** Ensure meats/eggs are fully cooked and cheeses are pasteurized; vary sides to cover micronutrients over the week.

**The Experiment:** Pick one balanced meal that always sounds good and put it on repeat this week.

**Why it Works:** Consistency beats perfection; repeating a well‑tolerated meal ensures steady nutrients.

**How to Try It:**
• Example: veggie omelet + toast; or turkey‑cheese melt (heated) + salad.
• Batch prep ingredients to reduce effort.
• Rotate sides/sauces to prevent boredom.

### 50. Eat with your non-dominant hand to slow down.

**The Experiment:** At one meal today, try eating with your non-dominant hand.[4]

**Why it Works:** This simple mechanical trick disrupts the automatic, mindless process of eating. The awkwardness forces you to slow down, pay more attention to each bite, and become more aware of your body's fullness cues.[4]

**How to Try It:**
• Simply switch your fork or spoon to the hand you don't normally use.
• This works best with meals that require utensils.
• Notice how it changes the pace and experience of your meal.

### 52. Use smaller plates to trick your brain into feeling full.

**The Experiment:** For your next meal, serve your food on a smaller plate (like a salad plate instead of a large dinner plate).[2]

**Why it Works:** It's a powerful visual illusion. A standard portion of food looks more abundant on a smaller plate, which can increase feelings of psychological satisfaction and fullness.[2, 9] This can help you naturally reduce your portion sizes without feeling deprived.

**How to Try It:**
• Use a 9-inch plate instead of a 12-inch one.[2]
• You can also try using smaller bowls and even smaller utensils, like appetizer forks, to further slow down your eating.[2, 3]

*Tip ID: `e5f6g7h8-f005-4005-b005-567890abcdef`*

### 53. Link drinking water to checking your phone.

**The Experiment:** For one day, make this your rule: **Every time you check your phone, take a sip of water.**[10]

**Why it Works:** This is a perfect example of habit stacking. It links a new, desired behavior (drinking water) to an existing, frequent habit (checking your phone), making it almost automatic.[10, 11] It's an effortless way to stay hydrated, as thirst is often mistaken for hunger.[3]

**How to Try It:**
• Keep a water bottle on your desk, in your bag, or wherever you spend the most time with your phone.
• The cue is the action of picking up or looking at your phone.[10]
• Don't worry about big gulps; small, consistent sips add up.

### 55. Use a spritz of water or vinegar to season popcorn.

**The Experiment:** Make a bowl of plain, air-popped popcorn. Instead of butter, lightly spritz it with water or plain vinegar before adding seasonings.[6]

**Why it Works:** This clever hack allows salt-free seasonings (like garlic powder, chili powder, or cinnamon) to stick to the popcorn without adding the fat and calories of butter or oil. The vinegar spritz creates a salt-and-vinegar flavor without the high-sodium seasoning packet.[6]

**How to Try It:**
• Use a small, clean spray bottle for the water or vinegar.[6]
• Spritz lightly, toss the popcorn, and then sprinkle on your seasoning.
• This makes a high-fiber, whole-grain snack that satisfies a crunchy craving.[12, 13]

*Tip ID: `h8i9j0k1-f008-4008-b008-890abcdef012`*

### 56. Make creamy 'ice cream' from frozen bananas.

**The Experiment:** When you crave ice cream, blend one or two frozen, sliced bananas in a blender or food processor until it reaches a smooth, soft-serve consistency.[12, 14]

**Why it Works:** This swap delivers the cold, creamy texture of ice cream using a whole fruit base. It's naturally sweet and provides fiber and potassium without the high levels of added sugar and saturated fat found in traditional ice cream.[12, 14]

**How to Try It:**
• Peel and slice ripe bananas before freezing them on a baking sheet.[12]
• You may need to add a splash of milk or stop and scrape down the sides of the blender a few times.
• Get creative by adding a spoonful of cocoa powder for chocolate 'nice cream' or other frozen fruits like berries.[2]

### 58. Get a quick pizza fix with this low-carb bowl.

**The Experiment:** For a super-fast, savory craving-buster, put some pepperoni, a spoonful of tomato sauce, and shredded mozzarella cheese in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until melty and gooey.[19]

**Why it Works:** This hack isolates the most craved flavors of pizza (the savory meat, tangy sauce, and melted cheese) without the high-carb crust. It's a quick, portion-controlled way to satisfy a specific craving in under two minutes.[19]

**How to Try It:**
• Use a few slices of pepperoni, about a tablespoon of sauce, and a sprinkle of cheese.[19]
• You can add other pizza toppings you have on hand, like sliced olives or mushrooms.
• Eat with a fork to slow down and savor the flavors.

### 60. Use a rotisserie chicken for fast, healthy protein all week.

**The Experiment:** Buy one rotisserie chicken during your weekly grocery shop. As soon as you get home, pull the meat from the bones and store it in the fridge.[22]

**Why it Works:** This is a meal prep game-changer for busy people. It provides a ready-to-use, versatile source of lean protein, eliminating the time and effort of cooking chicken during the week. This makes assembling healthy meals incredibly fast.[23, 22]

**How to Try It:**
• Add the shredded chicken to bagged salads for a quick lunch.[5]
• Use it as a filling for wraps or quesadillas with whole-wheat tortillas.[19, 23]
• Mix it with Greek yogurt or avocado for a healthier chicken salad.[24, 25]

### 61. Boost your breakfast with protein.

**The Experiment:** Start your day with a protein-rich breakfast, aiming for 15-25 grams.[1]

**Why it Works:** Protein is the most satiating macronutrient. It digests slowly and suppresses hunger hormones, which helps you feel full longer and can reduce cravings later in the day.[1, 2] Your body also burns more calories digesting protein compared to carbs and fats.

**How to Try It:**
• Swap a bagel or cereal for two eggs with whole-wheat toast and avocado.[1]
• Add a scoop of protein powder or a tablespoon of peanut butter to your oatmeal.[3]
• Top high-protein frozen waffles with nuts and berries.[1]

### 63. Swap sour cream for plain Greek yogurt or blended cottage cheese.

**The Experiment:** Instead of using sour cream as a topping (on tacos, chili, or baked potatoes) or in a dip, use plain nonfat Greek yogurt or blended low-fat cottage cheese.

**Why it Works:** This is a high-impact swap that dramatically increases protein while cutting fat and calories. Blended cottage cheese has a neutral, creamy flavor, while Greek yogurt offers a similar tangy taste to sour cream. Both options increase satiety.[4, 6]

**How to Try It:**
• Use a 1:1 ratio of plain Greek yogurt for sour cream.
• To make a creamy base, blend low-fat cottage cheese in a food processor or blender until completely smooth. You can add ranch seasoning for a high-protein veggie dip.[6]

---

### 64. Swap potato chips for air-popped popcorn.

**The Experiment:** When you're craving a crunchy, salty snack, reach for air-popped popcorn instead of potato chips.

**Why it Works:** Popcorn is a whole grain, providing significantly more fiber and volume for far fewer calories than chips. This satisfies the desire for a crunchy snack while helping you feel full and avoiding the high fat content of fried chips.[7, 8]

**How to Try It:**
• Use an air popper or the paper bag method in the microwave to pop plain kernels.
• Control the salt yourself and experiment with other seasonings like chili powder, garlic powder, or nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor.[7]

### 65. Swap ice cream for frozen grapes or 'nice cream'.

**The Experiment:** When a craving for a sweet, frozen dessert strikes, try eating a bowl of frozen grapes or making banana 'nice cream' instead of regular ice cream.

**Why it Works:** These swaps provide the sweet, cold, and creamy sensations of ice cream using whole fruits, which contain natural sugars, fiber, and micronutrients without the high levels of added sugar and saturated fat found in most ice creams.[9] Frozen grapes develop a sorbet-like texture.[10]

**How to Try It:**
• For frozen grapes, simply wash, dry, and freeze a bunch of grapes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Store in a freezer-safe bag.
• For 'nice cream', blend one or two frozen, sliced bananas in a blender or food processor until it reaches a smooth, soft-serve consistency.[11]

### 66. Swap ground beef for 99% lean ground turkey.

**The Experiment:** In a recipe that calls for ground beef, such as pasta sauce, tacos, or burgers, use 99% lean ground turkey or chicken instead.

**Why it Works:** This simple swap dramatically reduces the total and saturated fat content of your meal without sacrificing the satisfying texture of ground meat. This is an easy way to make favorite comfort foods healthier.[4, 6]

**How to Try It:**
• Substitute it 1:1 in any recipe.
• Since lean turkey is lower in fat, you may need to add a small amount of oil to the pan to prevent sticking.
• Be sure to season it well, as it has a milder flavor than beef.

### 68. Brush your teeth right after dinner to prevent evening snacking.

**The Experiment:** Tonight, make it a point to brush and floss your teeth immediately after you finish eating dinner.

**Why it Works:** This simple habit creates a powerful psychological cue that eating is finished for the day. The clean, minty feeling makes other foods and drinks (besides water) less appealing, which can effectively curb mindless late-night snacking or dessert cravings.[13]

**How to Try It:**
• As soon as you've cleared your plate, head to the bathroom and complete your dental routine.
• Make it a non-negotiable part of your dinner cleanup process.
• If a craving hits later, the thought of having to brush again can be a deterrent.

*Tip ID: `i8j9k0l1-0018-4018-a018-90ab12345678`*

---

### 69. Give your craving a goofy name ('Sir Crunch‑a‑Lot').

**The Experiment:** When an urge hits, name it out loud ('Hi, Sir Crunch‑a‑Lot—what's up?').
