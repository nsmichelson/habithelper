## Key Improvements from Original

1. **Clear Distinctions:**
   - Goals = aspirational outcomes (what you want)
   - Techniques = methods/strategies (how to get there)
   - Helps with = problems/pain points (what you're struggling with)

2. **Better Naming:**
   - Goals use positive, aspirational language ("manage" not "reduce")
   - Techniques use action-oriented language
   - Helps with describe the actual problem state

3. **No Overlaps:**
   - Each concept appears in only one category
   - Related concepts are clearly differentiated

4. **Hierarchical Organization:**
   - Grouped into logical subcategories
   - Makes it easier to find related tags

5. **User Psychology:**
   - Goals frame things positively
   - Problems are described neutrally (not judgmentally)
   - Techniques are concrete and actionable

## Implementation Notes

### For Algorithm Development
1. A tip can have multiple tags from each category
2. Match users to tips based on:
   - Their selected goals
   - Their identified problems (helps with)
   - Techniques they're willing/able to try

3. Scoring could work like:
   - High score if tip matches user's goal + current problem
   - Medium score if matches goal OR problem
   - Bonus points for techniques user has successfully used before

### For User Onboarding
1. First ask about goals (positive, aspirational)
2. Then sensitively ask about challenges (helps with)
3. Finally, ask about preferences for techniques

### For Tip Creation
Every tip should have:
- At least 1 goal it serves
- At least 1 technique it uses
- At least 1 problem it helps with
