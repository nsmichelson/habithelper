# Tip Template and Clinical Validation Process

This template structures each HabitHelper tip as a two-part artifact that combines an actionable micro-intervention with a transparent research rationale. The workflow includes clinical validation checkpoints to maintain fidelity to evidence standards.

## Tip Authoring Template

| Section | Description | Example Prompt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Actionable Micro-Intervention** | A single, concrete behavior that a user can complete within minutes. Use plain language, specify frequency or duration, and anchor to a habit trigger. | “Take a 2-minute mindful-breathing break before opening your email in the morning.” |
| **Research Rationale** | 2–3 sentences summarizing the evidence base: study type, population, and outcome relevance. Reference at least one source from the citation tracker with evidence level noted. | “Mindfulness-based brief practices reduce perceived stress in working adults, with randomized trials showing moderate effect sizes on anxiety symptoms.” |

### Writing Checklist

1. Confirm the action is feasible in <10 minutes and aligns with user context tags.
2. Reference evidence meeting guideline thresholds (see Clinical Guideline Evidence Audit).
3. Flag any cultural or accessibility considerations that may alter applicability.
4. Draft user-facing copy at an 8th-grade reading level; keep clinical detail in the rationale.

## Validation Workflow

1. **Author Draft**: Content strategist completes both template sections and logs supporting citations in the shared tracker.
2. **Clinical Lead Review**: Designated clinician verifies evidence strength, population fit, and safety notes. Approval or revision requests documented via comment in the tracker.
3. **Quality Assurance**: A second clinician or senior reviewer spot-checks randomized samples weekly to confirm adherence to template standards.
4. **Publication Sign-off**: Once approved, tag tip status as “Validated” in the CMS and record validation date.
5. **Maintenance Review**: Revalidate annually or sooner if new evidence updates the guideline hierarchy.

## Validation Log Fields

When submitting for clinical review, include the following metadata:

- Tip ID / draft slug
- Author name and date
- Primary guideline source (APA, NICE, WHO)
- Evidence level (e.g., Systematic Review, RCT, Implementation Study)
- Reviewer name, decision, and comments
- Date of validation and next scheduled review

## Communication with Clinical Leads

- Share new templates and updates during weekly clinical content syncs.
- Maintain a changelog documenting template adjustments and reviewer feedback.
- Provide clinicians with dashboard access to validation status metrics for transparency.
