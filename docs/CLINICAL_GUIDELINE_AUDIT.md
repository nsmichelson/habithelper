# Clinical Guideline Evidence Audit

This audit summarizes the minimum evidence levels and acceptable emerging-practice sources referenced in major, respected clinical practice guidelines relevant to behavioral health coaching interventions.

## Guideline Evidence Requirements

| Guideline Source | Minimum Evidence Standard | Acceptable Emerging-Practice Sources | Notes for HabitHelper |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| American Psychological Association (APA) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Psychological Practice | Prefers meta-analyses and systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs); when unavailable, high-quality RCTs with sufficient sample size and replication. | Quasi-experimental studies, well-designed observational cohorts, and expert consensus only when rigorous trials are not feasible; explicitly requires transparent limitations. | Prioritize APA-endorsed treatments (e.g., CBT) with RCTs/systematic reviews; flag any tip drawing from lower levels for clinical review. |
| National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Guidelines | Requires systematic reviews and RCTs; cost-effectiveness and implementation considerations derived from evidence-grade hierarchies (GRADE). | NICE allows carefully appraised qualitative evidence, case series, or expert testimony when evidence gaps exist, but assigns lower certainty ratings. | Map each tip to NICE evidence grade; if below “moderate” certainty, annotate rationale and constraints for product surfaces. |
| World Health Organization (WHO) mhGAP and digital health guidelines | Emphasizes systematic reviews of RCTs and pragmatic trials across global populations; adapts to resource variability. | Implementation research, pilot RCTs, and community-based participatory research for low-resource adaptations; must include cultural/contextual validation. | For globally distributed users, cross-check interventions against WHO recommendations; ensure culturally adaptive notes accompany emerging practices. |

## Evidence Acceptance Rules for HabitHelper

1. **Default requirement**: Cite systematic reviews or RCTs aligning with APA, NICE, or WHO guidance.
2. **Emerging practice**: Accept quasi-experimental, implementation, or qualitative evidence only when:
   - The guideline explicitly permits lower-level evidence due to feasibility constraints.
   - Limitations and population applicability are clearly documented.
   - Clinical leads approve provisional use and set a review timeline.
3. **Prohibited sources**: Anecdotal reports, unreviewed preprints, or media summaries cannot justify tips without corroborating peer-reviewed evidence.

## Next Steps

- Update the evidence tagging workflow to capture source guideline, study type, population, and strength of recommendation.
- Require clinical sign-off for any tip whose evidence level falls below the guideline minimum.
- Schedule semi-annual audits to incorporate updates from APA, NICE, and WHO publications.
