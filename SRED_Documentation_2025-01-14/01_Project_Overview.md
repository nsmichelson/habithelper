**Project: Habit Helper - Personalized Behavior Change Platform**

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the scientific research and experimental development (SR&ED) activities undertaken to develop an innovative adaptive recommendation system for behavior change interventions. The project involved solving multiple technological uncertainties that could not be resolved through routine engineering or standard practice.

## Project Context

Habit Helper is a React Native mobile application designed to help users change their nutritional habits through personalized daily "experiments" (micro-interventions). Unlike traditional habit trackers that rely on static content delivery, this system required development of novel algorithms and architectures to:

1. Learn from user feedback in real-time
2. Balance multiple competing constraints (medical safety, user preferences, content variety)
3. Maintain system stability across distributed mobile environments
4. Provide personalized recommendations without explicit user configuration

## Technological Uncertainties Addressed

### 1. Dynamic Recommendation Scoring Under Multiple Constraints
**Uncertainty**: How to develop an algorithm that could simultaneously optimize for user goal alignment, lifestyle compatibility, and safety constraints while maintaining content diversity.

### 2. Real-time Learning from Implicit Feedback
**Uncertainty**: How to interpret and learn from various user interactions (dismissals, snoozes, completions) to improve future recommendations without explicit ratings.

### 3. State Synchronization in Distributed Mobile Systems
**Uncertainty**: How to manage complex state transitions between persisted and transient states in an asynchronous mobile environment without creating race conditions or invalid states.

### 4. Medical Safety Validation at Scale
**Uncertainty**: How to implement a robust safety gating system that could prevent harmful recommendations across complex medical conditions and dietary restrictions.
