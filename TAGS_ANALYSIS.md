### EFFORT Tags

| Level | Exercise | Nutrition | Organization | Productivity | Relationships |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| minimal | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| low | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| medium | – | ✓ | – | – | – |
| moderate | ✓ | – | – | ✓ | – |

**Observation**: Nutrition is the only area still using the `medium` label; Exercise and Productivity reserve higher load experiments under `moderate`, while Relationships stay within minimal/low.

---

### SUSTAINABILITY Tags

| Pattern | Areas |
|---------|-------|
| daily | Exercise, Relationships |
| weekly | Exercise |
| as_needed | Nutrition, Organization, Productivity |
| ongoing | Nutrition |
| nightly | Organization, Productivity |

**Observation**: Relationships tips are all daily. Exercise is daily or weekly. Productivity and Organization emphasize flexibility (as_needed, nightly).

---

### TIME Tags

| Duration | Exercise | Nutrition | Organization | Productivity | Relationships |
|----------|----------|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| 0-5 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 5-15 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 15-30 | – | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 30-60 | – | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 60+ | – | ✓ (planned meal preps) | – | – | – |

**Observation**: Exercise remains the quickest category (0-15 minute loops). Relationships now borrow longer persona rituals (15-60 minutes) while Nutrition retains the widest range, with `60+` covering batch-prep experiments mapped from legacy planning tasks.
