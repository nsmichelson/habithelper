## Recommended New Rejection Reasons to Add

Based on this analysis, we should add these situational blockers to the rejection reasons:

### Immediate Circumstances (NEW CATEGORY)
```javascript
{
  value: 'wrong_situation',
  label: "Not in the right situation today",
  icon: 'calendar-outline',
  emoji: 'üìÖ',
  followUps: [
    { label: "No social plans today", value: 'no_social_plans', emoji: 'üë§' },
    { label: "Not eating out today", value: 'not_eating_out', emoji: 'üè†' },
    { label: "Not at home today", value: 'not_home', emoji: '‚úàÔ∏è' },
    { label: "Not at the office today", value: 'not_at_office', emoji: 'üè†' },
    { label: "Not grocery shopping today", value: 'no_shopping', emoji: 'üõí' },
    { label: "Wrong time of day for this", value: 'wrong_time', emoji: '‚è∞' },
    { label: "Weather doesn't permit", value: 'bad_weather', emoji: 'üåßÔ∏è' },
    { label: "Didn't prepare ahead for this", value: 'not_prepared', emoji: 'üìù' },
    { label: "Not feeling well today", value: 'feeling_sick', emoji: 'ü§í' },
    { label: "Traveling/on the go", value: 'traveling', emoji: '‚úàÔ∏è' },
  ]
}
```

### Equipment/Ingredients (UPDATE EXISTING)
Update the existing "no_access" and "no_equipment" categories to include:
- "Don't have these specific ingredients today"
- "Kitchen not available right now"
- "Equipment is broken/unavailable"

## Tips That Need Special Handling

These tips have very specific requirements that should trigger contextual rejection reasons:

1. **"Suggest a walk instead of coffee"** ‚Üí Needs "No social plans today"
2. **"Buy rotisserie chicken during shop"** ‚Üí Needs "Not shopping today"  
3. **"Brush teeth after dinner"** ‚Üí Needs "Wrong time of day" if shown in morning
4. **"Pack lunch night before"** ‚Üí Needs "Didn't prepare ahead"
5. **Restaurant-specific tips** ‚Üí Need "Not eating out today"
6. **Outdoor activity tips** ‚Üí Need "Weather doesn't permit"

## Implementation Notes

- These situational blockers should appear FIRST in the rejection list when relevant
- They're different from other rejections because they're temporary (today only)
- The tip might be perfect for the user, just not possible TODAY
- Consider tracking these separately - if user selects "not eating out today", that tip could be perfect for tomorrow if they ARE eating out
