    "details_md": "**The Experiment:** Carry ginger chews in your bag and keep a few by your bed. When nausea hits, slowly suck or chew one.\n\n**Why it Works:** Ginger compounds can calm the stomach and reduce nausea; having them pre-positioned makes relief immediate.\n\n**How to Try It:**\n• Stock a few in your purse, desk, and nightstand.\n• If strong ginger is too spicy, try milder ginger drops.\n• Start with small amounts and see what your stomach tolerates.",
    "contraindications": "Avoid if ginger worsens heartburn or if your clinician advised limiting ginger (e.g., on certain blood thinners). Large amounts of ginger may interact with blood thinners or increase reflux; limit if advised by your clinician.",
