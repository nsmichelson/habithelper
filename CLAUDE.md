I am developing a delightful, user-friendly react native and expo app called habit helper. Unlike standard habit trackers I want this app to be mostly about helping users figure out what works for them by giving them simple daily "experiments" to try in areas they want to make or break 
habits. For instance, let’s say I was focused on eating less sugar - one daily experiment tip I might get would be “sub carbonated water for soda today” and I can choose to “try it”, “not interested in trying” or “maybe try another day”.

I want this app to be THE go to app for "figuring out what works for me" when changing 
  habits. I want it to be approachable, fun, easy and delightful to use for all sorts of people - not just the usual fitness or 
  health fanatics but even normies like thoses that love sweets.  It should be extremely welcoming, easy to use and unintimidating to users.
